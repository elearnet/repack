`@callstack/repack-plugin-nativewind` is a plugin for `@callstack/repack` that enables integrating [NativeWind](https://github.com/nativewind/nativewind) into your React Native projects.

## About

This plugin seamlessly integrates NativeWind with Re.Pack's build process by:

- Configuring PostCSS and Tailwind CSS processing for your stylesheets
- Handling conversion of CSS to React Native-compatible styles
- Setting up proper SWC transformations for NativeWind's JSX runtime

## Installation

First, follow these steps from the official [NativeWind installation guide](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/react-native):

1. [Install NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/react-native#installation)
2. [Setup Tailwind CSS](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/react-native#2-setup-tailwind-css)
3. [Import your CSS file](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/react-native#5-import-your-css-file)
4. (Optional) [Setup TypeScript support](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/typescript)

Then install the Re.Pack NativeWind plugin and it's dependencies:

```sh
npm install -D @callstack/repack-plugin-nativewind postcss postcss-loader autoprefixer
```

These additional dependencies (`postcss`, `postcss-loader`, and `autoprefixer`) are required for processing Tailwind CSS with Webpack/Rspack, as specified in the [official Tailwind CSS Rspack guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/rspack). They enable PostCSS processing and autoprefixing of CSS styles in your build pipeline.

## Usage

> **Note**: If you are using Webpack (not Rspack), you need to add the following configuration to your `babel.config.js`:
>
> ```js
> plugins: [
>   [
>     '@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx',
>     {
>       runtime: 'automatic',
>       importSource: 'nativewind',
>     },
>   ],
> ],
> ```

### Plugin

To add the plugin to your Re.Pack configuration, update your `rspack.config.js` or `webpack.config.js` as follows:

```js
import { NativeWindPlugin } from "@callstack/repack-plugin-nativewind";

export default (env) => {
  // ...
  return {
    // ...
    plugins: [
      // ...
      new NativeWindPlugin(),
    ],
  };
};
```
